# Weather Dashboard
![MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue)
## Description
The application allows users to obtain current weather conditions and a 5-day weather forecast based on the location they have queried. When a search is performed, the following data is returned to the user: city name, date, an icon representing the weather conditions, the temperature, humidity, and wind speed. In addition to returning the data, the web application also stores the user's searches in their local storage. Storing searches will allow the user to view their search history, select any previous search and bring up the city's corresponding weather data.
